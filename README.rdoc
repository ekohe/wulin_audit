= WulinAudit

== How to Use


1. WulinAudit is depends on mongoDB database, before use it you need install mongodb.

   On Mac OS X using Homebrew:
    
    brew install mongodb
    
   On Ubuntu & Debian:
   please read the installation from mongoDB Official Website : {Ubuntu and Debian packages}[www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages].
    

2. Put <code>gem wulin_audit</code> to your Gemfile:

    gem wulin_audit

3. Run bundler command to install the gem:

    bundle install
   
3. Now, you have <b><em>WulinAudit::AuditLogsController</em></b> and <b><em>WulinAudit::AuditLog</em></b> model, and it will audit all the models automatically.

   Attributes in <code>WulinAudit::AuditLog</code>:
    
    user_id    # current user's id, equal to +User.current_user.try(:id)+
    user_email # current user's email, equal to +User.current_user.try(:email)+ 
    record_id  # id for record which was audited.
    action     # current action name
    class_name # class name for record which was audited 
    detail     # changes detail.

   WulinAudit will audit all the models automatically; 
   if you do not want audit some, use +reject_audit+ method:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      reject_audit
    end
  
   the +Post+ model will skip audit.
  
   If a module was audited, WulinAudit will audit all the columns automatically, 
   You also can control which columns need audit, you need use +audit_columns+ method:
  
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      audit_columns(%w(title content category) & column_names)
      audit_columns :title, :content, :category
      audit_columns 'title', 'content', 'category'
    end
   
   Note that, +audit_columns+ will be ignored when audit be rejected by +reject_audit+ method
